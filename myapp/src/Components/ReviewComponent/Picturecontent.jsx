            Why do so many construction companies fail? According to the US
            Department of Commerce, construction and contracting businesses have
            the highest failure rate of any other business. Up to 96% of these
            companies fail before reaching 10 years in business.

            You know exactly what I’m talking about if you own or operate a
            construction company. It is beyond difficult to build a successful
            construction business, and yet far easier to fail. Having owned
            multiple construction companies, I am speaking from experience. It
            took several years of iteration and learning before I finally
            figured it out.

            <b>Insufficient Cash Flow</b>
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "23px", color: "white" }}>
            Cash flow is king. Without a constant positive cash flow,
            construction companies and speciality contractors are finding it
            difficult to keep their doors open for business. Whether that be
            because they are struggling to pay for materials, meeting payroll,
            keeping up with advertising demands, or any other number of reasons.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "23px", color: "white" }}>
            When cash flow is negative, companies often make hasty decisions and
            take on jobs that aren’t well suited to their companies needs. This
            can result in further profit loss and more significant cash flow
            problems down the road – causing companies to fail. But, how do you
            maintain positive cash flow? Keep reading…
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "23px", color: "white" }}>
            <b>Charging too Little</b>
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "23px", color: "white" }}>
            Most, if not all, struggling construction companies and specialty
            contractors do not charge enough for their services. Many companies
            don’t realize that they are charging too little because they don’t
            fully understand their overhead and operating expenses.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "23px", color: "white" }}>
            The billing price of each successful job must cover job costs, its
            share of overhead costs, plus a resonable profit. To build a
            sustainable construction company I recommend a minimun of 8% profit.
            Failing to charge enough on each job will soon lead to problem
            number one: insufficient cash flow.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "23px", color: "white" }}>
            <b>Lack of Agreed Upon Payment Schedules</b>
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "23px", color: "white" }}>
            Outlining a cash flow protective payment schedule on estimates and
            customer contracts will set a construction company on the road to
            success. A payment schedule that requires the company to finance
            parts of the job will consume cash flow. And in doing so, ultimately
            limit success. Instead, ensure that payment schedules cover, at
            minimun, job expenses and associated overhead.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "23px", color: "white" }}>
            In my experience, a <b>40% down payment</b> on approved estimates
            and change orders works best. Have the customer follow up with
            weekly or biweekly progress payments that coincide with the
            percentage of completed work as outlined on the estimate. Customers
            rarely have a problem with well-documented and communicated payment
            schedules.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "23px", color: "white" }}>
            Communication and managing customer expectations is the key to
            success here.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "23px", color: "white" }}>
            <b>Insufficient Number of Profitable Sales</b>
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "23px", color: "white" }}>
            Many construction companies fail simply because they lack consistent
            and profitable jobs. For almost all businesses, advertising and one
            or more sales people are required to maintain a flow of consistent
            sales.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "23px", color: "white" }}>
            Additionally, a good website, search engine optimization (SEO), and
            a number of good online reviews will dramatically increase the flow
            of organic job leads. It’s common for construction companies to
            purchase job leads from companies like HomeAdvisor, Porch, Angies
            list, etc. Proper management of job leads and customer data will
            dramatically improve your ability to convert leads to sales.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "23px", color: "white" }}>
            For this you’ll need a construction Customer Relationship Management
            (CRM) software solution. For obvious reasons, I recommend{" "}
            <span style={{ color: "red" }}>Projul</span>. But in all honesty,

          <p style={{ marginTop: "23px", color: "white" }}>
            <b>Lack of Change Orders</b>
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "23px", color: "white" }}>
            Cha, cha, cha, changes… Unforeseen issues, customer scope creep, and
            upselling are just a few examples of why real time changes orders
            are needed on most construction and specialty contractor jobs.
            Waiting until the end of the job to tack on additional costs to the
            bill can be problematic. It will often result in customer sticker
            shock, bad reviews, and customer resistance to pay. Which in turn,
            leads to more cash flow problems and company failure.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "23px", color: "white" }}>
            When a job change occurs, the construction company should submit a
            change order to the customer for approval. Companies should request
            a deposit on change orders that are over a couple thousand dollars.
            Customers can get excited about the work that is being done until
            the final bill comes. Then they find themsleves over extended and
            unable to pay.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "23px", color: "white" }}>
            Having a signed change order and a deposit before the work begins
            ensures that the company and customer are on the same page.
            Ultimately improving cash flow and profitability. I highly recommend
            leaving very little money left on the table for the end of the job.
            Large payments due at the end of the project can be hard to collect.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "23px", color: "white" }}>
            <b>Take away –</b> Make consistent job progress, communicate
            progress and manage expectations with the customer, and pull
            progress payments to match. By the time the job is finished the
            customer should owe you a relatively small amount.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "23px", color: "white" }}>
            <b>Lack of Legal Contracts</b>
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "23px", color: "white" }}>
            It’s essential to establish common ground and strong communciation
            between the company and customer. Creating a detailed estimate and
            contract for the customer to sign is imperative toward achieving
            this goal.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "23px", color: "white" }}>
            There are as many bad customers out there as there are bad
            contractors. Some of those customers simply want to get the work
            done for free. They will argue about things that, they claim, were
            promised. A signed contract and detailed estimate will help to
            prevent this from happening.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "23px", color: "white" }}>
            <b>Excess Overhead and Employees</b>
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "23px", color: "white" }}>
            Don’t get too excited to add employees. Company growth is what you
            want. But only add each employee only when absolutely necessary and
            after ensuring that the company can afford to do it. Employee
            payroll is one of a company’s biggest expenses. Do the math to
            ensure an additional employee will help the bottom line. Otherwise,
            it’ll consume it’s cash flow.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "23px", color: "white" }}>
            When you do hire an employee, hire slow and fire fast. A great
            empowered employee often has the productivity of three or more bad
            employees. A bad employee can quickly poison your construction
            company and demotivate an entire team. This is especially true for
            small to mid-size companies. Unfortunately, I learned that the hard
            way many times. It’s unprofitable to be in the business of fixing
            bad employees.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "23px", color: "white" }}>
            <b>Lack of Organization, Processes & Decision Making Data</b>
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "23px", color: "white" }}>
            Growing a sustainable construction business is impossible when the
            bulk of the business is operating out of one person’s head. In order
            to grow, you’ll need projects and issues that can be efficiently
            managed by the people you hire to help you. To do so, you’ll need
            more data transparency, processes, and organization.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "23px", color: "white" }}>
            For larger companies that use sticky notes and boxes full of
            folders, you essentially have the same problem on a bigger scale.
            Job leads and customer management, project details, task management,
            communications, schedules, progress tracking, equipment management,
            the list goes on and on.

            Analyzing lead, advertising, sales, schedule, and project data from
            file folders and spreadsheets to make good business decisions is
            daunting. Each of these elements are extremely time consuming, error
            prone, and can negatively affect profitability and cash flow.
